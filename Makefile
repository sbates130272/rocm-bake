# tailnet, so this variable keeps the real hostname.
# (THINK_HOST and GAMING_HOST are defined below.)

# The tailnet must never go through the corporate proxy. HTTP_PROXY and
# HTTPS_PROXY are set in this environment but no_proxy is not, so every
# proxy-aware tool (curl in some modes, python urllib, Go binaries like
# zli and docker) tries to reach snoc-* through ZScaler and fails. Set
# it here so make targets are correct regardless of the user's shell;
# add the same to your profile for interactive use.

# BUILD_DATE only reaches the `created` LABEL. The image *config* has a
# `created` field of its own, which BuildKit stamps with nanosecond
# wall-clock time regardless — so two builds of identical content got
# different config digests, different manifest digests, and every
# downstream FROM missed. SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH is what pins that field.
#
# Per image, not per repo. Taking it from HEAD meant every commit gave
# the base a new `created`, hence a new digest, hence a full downstream
# rebuild — even for a commit that only touched the Makefile. Measured:
# Dockerfile.base unchanged between cf70d3c and 87f539e, yet the base
# digest moved 91db3c2e -> aa52684f and nothing downstream could hit.
#
# A constant, not a date derived from history.
#
# This was `git log -1 --format=%ct -- Dockerfile.<image>`, on the
# reasoning that an image's timestamp should move only when its own
# inputs do. That used commit history as a proxy for "the inputs
# changed", and the proxy does not hold: squashing 26 commits into 3
# made every remaining commit touch every Dockerfile, so all five
# values collapsed to one timestamp and every image's cache was
# invalidated at once. Any rebase, squash or filter-branch does this.
#
# Content is what should decide, and content already does — it decides
# the layer digests. The config `created` field carries no information
# anyone reads: the real build date lives in the
# org.opencontainers.image.created label, and BASE_LABELS deliberately
# omits even that. So pinning it to a constant costs nothing and is
# immune to history being rewritten. Changing a Dockerfile still
# changes that image's digest, because its layers change.
#
# Bump this only to force every image to a new digest deliberately.
SDE_EPOCH   ?= 1700000000

# The sccache store every node shares: nginx WebDAV over a directory

#
# WebDAV has no stats verb, so unlike memcached the store cannot report
# hit rates — only size and object count. Hit rates come from sccache
# itself, which prints --show-stats at the end of each build.
# The other cache. sccache stores compiler objects; this is buildkit's
# layer reuse, and the two move independently — a Dockerfile edit can
# drop layer reuse to 5% while sccache still serves every compile.
#
# Keyed by image, not by node. Which node a target ran on is an
# artefact of scheduling — the balancer moves targets between nodes run
# to run — so a per-node view answers "what did this machine last do"
# when the question is "how much of this image did we rebuild". The
# node is still shown, because it explains a low number: a target that
# moved nodes cannot use the previous node's local buildkit cache and
# must refetch from Zot.
