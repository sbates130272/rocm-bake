#!/bin/bash
# balance.sh - schedule bake targets across the fleet by current load.
#
# Why this exists: buildx's multi-node builder does not balance. Node
# selection is driven by platform matching, and when every node
# advertises linux/amd64 the choice among them ignores capacity — we
# watched all five targets land on snoc-gaming (16 cores, 15GB) while
# snoc-think (32 cores, 122GB) sat idle. There is no hook to change
# that, so the scheduling happens here instead: one bake invocation per
# target, each pinned to a builder we pick.
#
# Consequence: targets must exchange results through the registry
# rather than bake's `target:` contexts, because those only work within
# a single invocation. So every stage pushes, and later stages pull.
#
# Usage: ./balance.sh [--dry-run]
#
# Env:
#   NODES        space-separated builder names (default: the snoc-* set)
#   REGISTRY     passed through to bake
#   MIN_MEM_GB   skip nodes with less free memory than this (default 8)

# Stages run in order; targets within a stage run concurrently on
# different nodes. The dependencies are real: pytorch needs base, and
# aiter needs both pytorch and the triton wheels.
# Order within a stage is priority, not preference: targets are handed
# to nodes best-first, so the most expensive target must be listed
# first or it gets whatever is left. That was backwards for stage 3 —
# aiter-wheel was last, so the 50-minute kernel compile landed on the
# weakest node at MAX_JOBS=12 while two targets costing 67s and 32s
# took snoc-think's 32 jobs.
# Overridable so a run can skip a target without editing this file —
# e.g. STAGE_3="pytorch-wheel" to build a new arch without AITER, which
# costs more than everything else combined.
STAGE_1="${STAGE_1:-pytorch-base}"
# triton-wheel before pytorch, not beside it: the pytorch image now
# installs our triton wheel, so it needs that target's result. They
# used to run concurrently on two nodes; this costs triton's duration
# on the critical path (~90s once its cache is warm, since the build is
# architecture-independent and hits 100%).
STAGE_2="${STAGE_2:-triton-wheel}"
STAGE_2B="${STAGE_2B:-pytorch}"
# pytorch-run omitted: no node has a working GPU, so the runtime image
# cannot be exercised and is not worth a slot. Add it back here when
# one does.
# Three targets, which is the first stage wide enough to use the whole
# fleet. nixl-wheel used to sit in a stage of its own; it only needs
# pytorch, so it belongs here beside the other two. That removed a
# serial stage and took stage width from 2 to 3.
#
# Width is the whole game for this scheduler: it parallelises *within* a
# stage, so a one-target stage always goes to the single best node no
# matter how the others score. Stages 1, 2 and 2B are width-1 because
# the dependency chain genuinely is serial there.
STAGE_3="${STAGE_3:-aiter-wheel nixl-wheel pytorch-wheel}"
# cupy-wheel needs only pytorch-base, so in principle it could run in
# stage 1. It is here because lmcache consumes it and nothing earlier
# does, and because stage 3 is already the widest point — adding a
# fourth target there would oversubscribe a three-node fleet.
STAGE_3B="${STAGE_3B:-cupy-wheel}"
# The serving stack. nixl-wheel is its own stage because both vllm and
# lmcache consume it; vllm first in stage 5 because it is the expensive
# one (AITER-dependent) and stage order is priority, not preference.
#
# These are only reachable here because bake resolves their inputs from
# the registry under PUBLISHED_INPUTS (exported below) rather than from
# sibling targets. Without it each would rebuild pytorch, triton, aiter
# and nixl on whichever node it landed on.
# lmcache before vllm, not beside it. vllm's bake target now takes a
# lmcache-wheel context (vLLM ships the MP connector but imports
# lmcache.utils from it), and on this path the stages hand results over
# through Zot — so the wheel has to be *published* before vllm starts,
# not merely building on some other node.
