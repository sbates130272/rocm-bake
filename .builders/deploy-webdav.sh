# deploy-webdav.sh - Durable sccache object store on SNOC Strix.
#
# Durable by design: the objects are files on disk, so a power cycle
# on Strix leaves the fleet's compiler cache intact. An in-RAM store
# does not survive one, and an overflow-to-disk tier is not the same
# thing — it is a spill target, not something read back at startup.
#
# WebDAV rather than S3/MinIO: dl.min.io is blocked by the corporate
# proxy and MinIO is not packaged, whereas nginx with the dav modules
# is a normal apt install. sccache speaks WebDAV natively via
# SCCACHE_WEBDAV_ENDPOINT.
#
# Usage: sudo ./deploy-webdav.sh [port]
#
# Storage is a plain directory tree, so it survives reboots, can be
# backed up with rsync, and is bounded only by the filesystem.

# how a reboot took the fleet's cache offline while the data itself was
