#!/bin/bash
# deploy-memcached.sh - Install and configure the shared sccache object
# store on SNOC Strix. Run on Strix only; think and gaming are clients.
#
# Usage: sudo ./deploy-memcached.sh [ram_mb] [disk_size]
#
#   ram_mb      RAM ceiling in MB   (default 8192)
#   disk_size   extstore file size  (default 200G)
#
# This is the single cache all three build nodes share. Each node runs
# its own sccache server — the client/server protocol needs the server
# to see the source tree, so a shared *server* is impossible — and they
# all read and write objects here. An object compiled on Strix is a hit
# on thinkstation and gaming.
#
# memcached is chosen for extstore: above the RAM ceiling item data goes
# to a file on disk, with only keys and pointers kept in memory. That
# tiering is the whole point — a PyTorch object cache outgrows any
# sensible RAM budget, and the alternative stores sccache supports
# either cap hard at memory size or need a separate object server.
