#!/bin/bash
# bench.sh - measure build time under cold, warm and hot cache conditions.
#
# The three scenarios exist because they fail differently, and only one
# of them is the common case:
#
#   cold  No layer cache, no compiler cache. What a new machine or a
#         changed base image costs. Upper bound.
#   warm  Layer and compiler caches are populated, but SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH
#         moved — which is what every new commit does, including commits
#         that touch nothing this image depends on. This is the case
#         that matters day to day, and the one currently broken: a new
#         commit gives the base a new digest, so every downstream FROM
#         misses even though no input changed.
#   hot   Same commit, everything cached. Lower bound; mostly a check
#         that the caches are being read at all.
#
# Cold runs are isolated by SCCACHE_WEBDAV_KEY_PREFIX so they never
# pollute or evict the fleet's shared compiler cache. The prefix is a
# directory in the WebDAV store and is deleted afterwards. Verified:
# writes land under /var/cache/sccache-webdav/<prefix>/.
#
# Results append as JSON lines, one per build, so a partial run is still
# usable and successive nights accumulate rather than overwrite.
#
# Usage:
#   ./bench.sh <scenario> [target ...]     run one scenario
#   ./bench.sh all                         cold, then warm, then hot
#   ./bench.sh report                      render results as markdown
