# Reads PIDs recorded by the things that start builds, rather than
# matching command lines. Two earlier attempts used `pgrep -f` and both
# killed the shell that invoked them: the patterns ("balance.sh",
# "buildx bake") appear verbatim in the command line of whatever ran
# make, and in this recipe's own subshells, so the search matched
# itself. A recorded PID cannot do that.
#
# It also keeps the blast radius right. The builders are shared with a
# sibling project; killing by pattern would stop its builds too.
#
# Killing the client is what cancels the build — buildkitd aborts a
# solve when its client disconnects. There is no `buildx cancel`.
