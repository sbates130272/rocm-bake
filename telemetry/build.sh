# build.sh - run a bake invocation and record telemetry for it.
#
# Usage: telemetry/build.sh [bake args...]
#        telemetry/build.sh --builder snoc-pool pytorch
#
# Runs `docker buildx bake -f rocm-bake.hcl "$@"`, then writes Prometheus
# metrics for every build that invocation produced: wall-clock duration,
# BuildKit layer-cache hit ratio, and sccache compiler-cache counters.
# Exits with the bake's own status, so it is safe to use in place of a
# bare bake call.
#
# Metrics go to $TEXTFILE_DIR (default: node_exporter's textfile
# collector) when that is writable, otherwise to ./telemetry/out. The
# file is written to a temp path and renamed, so node_exporter never
# reads a half-written file.
#
# Env:
#   BUILDER       buildx builder to read history from (default: current)
#   TEXTFILE_DIR  output directory
#   BAKE_FILE     bake definition (default: rocm-bake.hcl)

    # sccache counters come from the build log: the server lives and dies
    # with the build container, so its stats cannot be queried after the
    # fact. Dockerfile.pytorch prints `sccache --show-stats` as the last
    # thing the build step does.
    # buildx writes the replayed build log to stderr, not stdout.
    #
    # A record contains more than its own target's steps. pytorch pulls
    # triton-wheel in as a named context, so both are solved together
    # and both print a stats block into the pytorch record's log. A
    # bare `tail -1` took whichever block sorted last by step number,
    # which is triton's:
    #
    #   #27 262.2 Cache hits  5674   <- pytorch, the record's own target
    #   #28  95.6 Cache hits   361   <- triton, built as its dependency
    #
    # So every pytorch build was reported with triton's figure. The
    # vertex headers cannot disambiguate here — in a replayed record
    # they are all a bare "[builder 10/11]", with no bake-target prefix.
    #
    # What does identify the step is the file each Dockerfile tees its
    # stats to, which names the image. The step's RUN text is in its
    # header, so finding the marker gives the step number, and the
    # stats lines carrying that number are the ones to read.
    #
    # The legacy fallback matters for a few hours after the rename that
    # made these filenames unique: triton and aiter both used to tee to
    # /wheels-sccache-stats.txt, so records written before it aged out
    # would match no marker and silently drop their sccache numbers
    # from `make watch`. Those old records are genuinely ambiguous and
    # cannot be attributed exactly, but a possibly-imprecise number
    # beats a blank panel until they expire.
